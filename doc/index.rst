Account Payment Gateway Module
##############################

The Account Payment Gateway module offers a flexible payments model which allows
multiple payment gateways to co-exist in a single Tryton database. The
logic for storing payment profile and transactions are decoupled from the
gateway specific implementation itself making it easy to create custom
payment gateways with their own processing logic and feature sets.
